# Gemini-Driven-PDF-s-Question-Answering-System

Project Overview
This project implements an intelligent Question-Answering System for PDF documents, powered by Gemini. The system extracts text from PDF files, processes it using advanced NLP models, and allows users to ask questions related to the content. The answers are derived directly from the document, making it ideal for use cases such as legal documents, research papers, and manuals.

Features
#### PDF Text Extraction: Efficient extraction of text from PDF files using Python libraries.
#### Gemini Integration: Uses the Gemini model for question answering based on the extracted PDF text.
#### Real-time Querying: Allows users to input questions, which are answered by searching through the PDF content.
#### OCR Support: Integrated OCR functionality for scanned or image-based PDFs (requires additional setup).
#### User-Friendly Interface: Simple command-line or web-based interface (depending on the implementation).


## Advantages:-

#### Efficient document processing (text and image-based PDFs).
#### Advanced NLP capabilities using Gemini for accurate, context-aware answers.
#### Time-saving by quickly providing answers from documents.
#### Scalable for enterprise-level document management.
#### Customizable for various document types and industries.
#### OCR integration for extracting text from scanned documents.
#### User-friendly command-line or web-based interface.
